Registration-Bridge by Derek Williams

Simple as any other plugin for Wordpress.

This plugin allows you to add it to the plugins area on several sites.  For the main site registration this plugin allows you to set what site will store the main user information.


If main.com was the main site it would be the site that the connected site would reference to match Username and Passwords.
- Disable registration on the sub-domain (ex. dog.main.com) or other site (ex. magic.com).  These will be the read only sites.

This plugin will allow users with Username and Password to login with same credientals from the main site creating a bridge.

Note:  This plugin was only created for this method.

Steps:
1. Main registration
2. Secondary sites: use Username and Password admin/customers/users/subscribers etc... to log into secondary sites from Main Site creation.

You:
Add your own code to upgrade this plugin: You can add more to recognize cookies so if a user logged in on main site the secondary sites will recognize that and have them logged in on the secondary sites as well.
